## Download Pretrained Weights
We provide five pretrained weights
1. ViLT-B/32 Pretrained with MLM+ITM for 200k steps on GCC+SBU+COCO+VG (ViLT-B/32 200k) [link](https://github.com/dandelin/ViLT/releases/download/200k/vilt_200k_mlm_itm.ckpt)
2. ViLT-B/32 200k finetuned on VQAv2 [link](https://github.com/dandelin/ViLT/releases/download/200k/vilt_vqa.ckpt)
3. ViLT-B/32 200k finetuned on NLVR2 [link](https://github.com/dandelin/ViLT/releases/download/200k/vilt_nlvr2.ckpt)
4. ViLT-B/32 200k finetuned on COCO IR/TR [link](https://github.com/dandelin/ViLT/releases/download/200k/vilt_irtr_coco.ckpt)
5. ViLT-B/32 200k finetuned on F30K IR/TR [link](https://github.com/dandelin/ViLT/releases/download/200k/vilt_irtr_f30k.ckpt)

## Requirement for the Geometric inspired attack
Download : [counter-fitting word embeddings.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bayGomljWb6HeYDMTDKXrh0HackKtSlx)

To compute the synonym selection we need the cosine similarity scores between word pairs based on **counter-fitting word embeddings.**
